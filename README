Requires nmsg available from  Farsight Security.
Requires libev.
Just run "make".
Edit the Makefile to update install location if necessary.
Run "make install".

Typical usage:
  /usr/local/bin/nmsg-httpk 0.0.0.0 80 127.0.0.1 11430 base ConfickerC

  Listens on all interfaces port 80 and sends NMSG output to
  loopback port 11430.  Sets Operator to "base" and Group to "ConfickerC".
  An nmsgtool listening to port 11430 would then take care of forwarding
  data to other SIE infrastructure.
